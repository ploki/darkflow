This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to DarkFlow. We’ll cover topics such
as getting DarkFlow up and running, creating and managing your image processing workflows,
understanding the way an image processing operator works, getting the best from your astronomical photographs, and give you some advice on participating in the future
development of DarkFlow itself.

## So what is DarkFlow, exactly?

DarkFlow is a node based image processor for astronomers.

This software is dedicated to astronomical images processing.
It gives you the opportunity to track the processing of your
images using a non destructive approach. So you no longer
need to use your memory to replay treatments you have
taken some much time to implement.
